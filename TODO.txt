Notes from LAGraph meeting, Mar 20, 2024:

    v1.2:
        * now using v2.1 C API, but requires a recent SS:GraphBLAS
            (add v8.3.x and latest v9.0.3 to CI)?
        * test coverage of new experimental methods
        * any polished algorithms to move from experimental -> src?

    Future:
        * add support for complex data types in LAGraph? GrB?
            see sparse BLAS effort; they need complex

Notes from LAGraph meeting, June 14, 2023:

    For LAGraph 1.2:

        * move algorithms from experimental to src
        * use v2.1 C API spec

        * test coverage of new experimental methods
        * need faster MM reader/writer


    LDBC: updates, in src, and experimental <<<<
    polished experimental --> to src

        
document promotion from experimental to src
    (checklist)

    (1) doxygen comments in LAGraphX.h -> LAGraph.h
    (2) match error codes, msg usage
    (3) unit test, experimental/test/test_HelloWorld
        kinds of tests
        (a) reimplement algo in C, compare w LAGraph
        (b) check validity after getting LAGraph result
        (c) bespoke sample results from other packages
            for specific graph test cases
        (d) smoke test ... need more than this
    (4) experimental/benchmark/hello_demo.c
    (5) performance OK? compared to what baseline?
        time and memory

    (6) How GraphBLASy is it?
    (7) GxB or vanilla?
